What is Computer Graphics?
=========================

Computer graphics is any computed graph. Computer graphics can be used to 
create an interface for users, but also for many other things such as 
making games, displaying images, or charting data. Computer graphics are 
usually diplayed by a monitor or printer, and a graphics card, be it 
integrated or dedicated, is required to display to a monitor. Computer 
graphics can be manipulated, using image manipulation software, or other 
more specific software.
