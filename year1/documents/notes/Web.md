================================

Web Server
----------
A web server is a large powerful computer that listens to
network connections and responds to them with webpages.
Web servers can be outsourced or hosted locally.

File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
----------------------------
FTP is one of the original W3 protocols and is used to
transfer files in plain text over network sockets. Although
now deprecated by FTPS, Git, SVN, and SCP, FTP is still
sometimes used to transfer webpages and update web related
files on web servers.

Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML)
-------------------------
HTML is a language used to set the layout of a webpage.
This communicates with the browser and tells it where
to render the text, images, canvas elements, or plugins
on the webpage.

Web Authoring Tools
-------------------
Web authoring tools are a software type that aims to
aid in the creation of webpages. Software includes
Drupal, Plone, WordPress, and DotClear. These software
usually offer wizards and tools for creating visually
pleasing websites, and tools for debugging and profiling
your page to maximize speed and minimize bugs for those
less used to creating webpages.

Static Webpage
--------------
A static webpage is a webpage that uses no JavaScript
and none of the new HTML5 features. This leaves the
webpage rather dull looking, but is incredibly efficient
with regards to download time and page load time. 
Static webpages are ofter referred to as 'Web 1.0',
as opposed to the commonly referred 'Web 2.0' of today.

Browser (Web)
-------------
A web browser is an HTML reader that fetches HTML from
HTTP servers, and displays HTML, applies CSS, and executes
JavaScript. The web browser is also responsible for
providing the base functions of JavaScript.

Browser Compatibility
---------------------
Browser compatibility is a common problem for web
developers a large part of web development persists
of checking a webpages compatibility with other browsers
in an array of versions. This is mainly as the
interpretation of JavaScript is different from browser
to browser. This is also true for HTML, but more so for
CSS as they are interpreted differently.

Web server Software (HTTPd)
------------------
An HTTP daemon is the software used to supply clients
with the files required to load a webpage, amongst other
uses. Examples of HTTPd software includes: Apache, Nginx,
and Python-SimpleHTTPServer.

Dynamic Webpage
---------------
A dynamic webpage, in contrast to a static webpage, is
a webpage that allows the user to interact with the format.
Utilizing things such as hover-over menus and non-reload
page updates. This allows the user a better user experience
and makes it easier to store a large amount of information
on a single page, and to be able to display it all without
reloading the page. This does however make it take longer
to load the page initially.

Platform Compatibility
----------------------
Platform compatibility is whether or not a webpage displays
correctly from platform to platform. This is because OS
have different ways of displaying images and text, and this
can sometimes lead to issues.
