Suggesting Information systems
==============================

##Intro
In this document I will be reccomending two information systems that could 
be used by ITECH.

##Stock Control System
A stock control system will automatically order stock or notify staff when 
the stock of an item runs low. There system will order the average number 
of products sold in a month. One reason they should use this system is to 
reorder stock that has sold out, so that they can sell as much as possible. 
If the company were not to have this system, there would be a possibility 
that the company would go out of stock of a product, and when a customer 
asks for it, it will take several days to arrive. This is bad for business 
as the customers that want out of stock prodeucs are likely to go 
elsewhere, with bod impressions of the business.

##Automated Telephone System
This system allows customers that call the business to receive better 
customer service by forwarding them to the correct employee. This saves 
them time a makes it so that the customer is more likely to buy more 
products as the time taken to contact an employee will be signifigantly 
reduced. Customer may become frustrated with having to spend long periods 
of time on the phone, and that may convince them to spend less money with 
the company, and less likely to return.
