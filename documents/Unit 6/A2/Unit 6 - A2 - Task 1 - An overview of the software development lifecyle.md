Determination of Scope
----------------------
This is basically what the customer wants or does not want. It can be 
abtained by asking the customer, and it is required because it is important 
to know what your customer needs before you start planning.

Requirements gathering and specification
----------------------------------------
Once you have what the customer wants in mind, we can start to gather the 
requirements that we would need to carry out the job. For example, if you 
need to make a website, you will need a webserver.

as designing the structure of the back end of the project, so for the 
wesite example: The design of the webpage, and also the design of the
