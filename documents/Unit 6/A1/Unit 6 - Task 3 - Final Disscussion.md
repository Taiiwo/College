#The Importance the Quality of code

##Working in a Software Development Team

Working in a software development team is an act that requires a high qualtiy of code. It is so important in a team, as during the project's expansion, different people will be asked to work with your code, and it could save a lot of time explaining the code to them. Another reason it is important that your code is of quality is due to the concision of the execution of the code. If everyone is writing concise code, your project is sure to function faster.
##Maintenance (Updating Prices)

One of the main advantages to writing quality code is that of the efficiency of updating key elements of the program easily. For example, if the system was for a supermarket, it would be important to be able to update the prices efficiently and easily. This can be acheived by inputting the prices in a sensible data type, and maybe even creating a user interface for editing the prices. You could even go as far as to create a system to update prices automatically.

##Customer expectations

Writing quality code is, if not indirectly, one of your customer's expectations of you and your software. This may be indirect as the quality of the code could influence some of the customer's main expectations, such as often updates, and few bugs.

##Indentation

Indentation is important in code as it improves the readability of code drastically. Some languages even require indentation, and will not function without it, as shorhand for syntaxes seen in other languages. Indentation allows you to quickly see which peice of code belongs to which statement. Lastly, it helps some IDEs to highlight the syntax correctly.
Cosistant indentation is another important factor in the quality of your code. Incorrect indentation can lead to confusion, and in format sensitive languages, will cause the program to malfunction, even to the extent of combining 'tabs'( ) with 'spaces'( )

##Sensible Variable Names

Sensible varibales name vast improve the quality of code. It is the act of appropriately naming data varibles, and allows others to gain a better understanding of your code. This saves time improves the overall value of the code.

##Sensible Function Names

Function names could even be deemed more important than variable names in terms of the importance of being named correctly. This is so as it improves the both the other member's of the team's ability to understand and expand upon the code within it, but also the user of any libraries that you decide to distribute. With the added bonus of making the implementation of those functions easier to understand, as the function name should sum up the entire use of the function.
