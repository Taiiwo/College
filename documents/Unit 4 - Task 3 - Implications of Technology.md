###Sainsburys
Sainsburys have made technological advancements by installing self service checkouts in local shops. This is an area that not many other supermarkets have invested in, as it is assumed that a local shop would get much less use out of the tills than a larger store. This is bad because the tills cost a lot of money to set up, payed for all of the components outlines in task 2 P1.

###Morrisons
Interestingly, Morrisons is the only one of the four major super markets not to invest in an online sales system. It is speculated that this is not due to them not wanting a presence online, but sue to the fact that all of the other supermarkets have such an advanced setup at the moment, having hourly delivery cycles and such, make it incredibly hard to join the advancement at such a late stage. An entire delivery system would need to by implemented for a store, and well as a website and server to host the user interface.

###TESCO
The advancements of TESCO have already gone into major examination during this topic, but I think that the main one of TESCO's advancements is the loyalty card system. Some think that the reason TESCO implemented this system is to enforce the impression that TESCO want to give something back to it's customers for being so loyal. I think this has been a key part in it's success, being the most used loyalty system in the UK

###ASDA
ASDA is the supermarket the people often associate with competitive pricing. I wouldn't say that ASDA's competitive pricing is the first of it's kind, or even the first among supermarkets, but I think that they have taken it the most seriously, and I think that their pricing is what sets them apart as a supermarket. This is the reason I think as to why ASDA hasn't invested in many technological advancements, as to keep their prices low, they need to refrain from any unnecessary costs.

###Conclusion
My conclusion is that TESCO has made the best success out of technological advancements. This is due to their loyalty card system in my opinion.
