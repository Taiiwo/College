## Data Invalidation

The data may be invalid as the system put in place to record the data does not perform sufficient data validation.

## Required Data Validation

Data validation that would need to be performed by the input program would be a system to input data by account, so only one technician can input data from them. This would stop incorrect spelling of names. Another improvement would be to add a drop down menu for problem description instead of having the user type it in each time. This way, you won't have misspelled descriptions.
 
## The Data in the Database may be Invalid

This is because the data input system is flawed, and allows invalid data.

##What I did to invalid data

To find invalid data, I made the graphs I required, but spotted anomalous results. When I found anomalous data, I corrected the data to what I thought it is supposed to be. This isn't ideal, but it is the best that can be done to invalid data.

##The fields I chose
I chose were:
Fault ID	Date Logged	Fault Description	Customer ID	Chargeable	Tech. Staff	Date Completed
I chose these as I found them necessary to complete the task.

##The fields I added.
To complete the task, I needed to add certain fields to the sheet.
