===============================
-------------------------------
###Intro
This report will investigate and explain a few of TESCO's technological advancements. The purpose of this report is to bring attention to the technological advancements that made it to TESCO floors, and one that didn't.

###Adapting Business Processes
TESCO have adapted their business process by dropping prices to be competitive. Competitive pricing helps the company to beat their competitors by enticing their customers to buy from them. This also improves customer loyalty. It can't be said that TESCO were the first to do this as it's been a major function of the economy, but they definitely pushed price comparison and competitive pricing very early on the their development. 

###Purchasing Strategies 
The main purchasing strategy employed by TESCO is their automated ordering system. This system will order more products when the company is running low. This allows the staff to save time on ordering products and counting stock. 
###Customer Support Processes for Online Systems
These are systems put in place to support the customer when they are buying online. This improves customer loyalty, as the customers know that they will be able to get help if it's required. 

###Financial systems for secure fund transfers
An example of this is the SSL encryption. TESCO use this on all of their servers for safe transaction for the customer. This makes the system secure, and ensures that the customers' information is never shared. 

###No response 
In 2004, TESCO attempted to create a TV channel called 'TESCO TV'. TESCO invested in 5000 flat screen TVs to put up in stores. The downfall was the assumption that advertisers would run the same ads in-store as on TV. This seemed to be predicated on a misconception that consumers had the same level of engagement when shopping as they did in front of the TV at home.
