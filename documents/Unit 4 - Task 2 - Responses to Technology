The main pruchacing strategy employed by TESCO is their automated ordering system. This system will order more products when the company is running low. This allows the staff to save time on odering products and counting stock.

##Customer Support Processes for Online Systems
These are systems put in place to support the customer when thay are buying online. This improves customer loyalty, as the customers know that they will be able to get help if it's required.
