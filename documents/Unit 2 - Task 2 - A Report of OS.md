###Purpose
The purpose of an operating system is to create an interface for users to control the computer and it's hardware in some way. The operating system is responsible for all communication with the hardware, sometimes by communicating through the BIOS (In cases where hardware acceleration is not utilized)

###Function

An OS have 5 main functions.

- Manages memory
- - Allocates and retrieves data to and from memory addresses in the RAM
- Process allocation
- - Controls the movement of data through CPU memory buffers
- Hardware interface
- - Provides an interface to the hardware for the software
- Storage read/write
- - Allocates and retrieves data to and from memory addresses in storage media

###Usage
The way most modern desktop operating systems are used is via a GUI. This is most commonly the 'window' based layout, where programs apear in boxes, and the user has the ability to run multiple programs at a time. 

The only other non-GUI OS type commonly used today is the command line interface OS. These are most commonly used in large servers. These servers are used for their constant uptime and large power, so getting rid of un-needed addons is essentail to having a reliable and efficient server.

###OS Examples
An example of a GUI-based OS is 'elementaryOS'. elementaryOS is an Ubuntu based OS with a custom window shell called 'Pantheon'. It is aimed at the average user for desktop computing. The GUI is extensive and built for end to end quality, and the Linux base keeps it flexible and secure. Drawbacks include it's unoptimized performance that comes with a GUI based OS, and would be a unsuitible OS for a server for this reason.

On the other hand, and example of a command line OS is 'FreeBSD'. FreeBSD is a distribution of the BSD OS that focuses on free licencing. Due to the superior process distribution system, FreeBSD is a very popular server OS as it can deliver unmached speed and reliability. The only drawback of using FreeBSD is that due to the different pre-execution procedures, programs must be recompiled with special options in order to support the OS, and although all of the best and most popular server-oriented programs (Such as Apache and MySQL) have already been compiled, FreeBSD compilation is far down the list of priorities for most of the newer software, unfortunately.
