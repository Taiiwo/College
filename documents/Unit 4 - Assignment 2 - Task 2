Unit 4 - Assignment 2 - Task 2
==============================

Cost Analysis
-------------
Due to the rather cheap implementation of the invoation, I project that this change will make a large return on investment. As I projected in the presentation in task 1, the BTC NFC port will generate £5,000 extra revenue every year. This number, with the cost of implementation deducted is £4,953.24 total extra revenue per year.

Barriers to Change
------------------
As with all technological advancements, there are always some complications, and not everything always goes to plan. Things to look out for while implementing this is to make sure that the user understands the full benefits to using BTC instead of real cash, as, although the currency is on the news quite often; it is not yet part of genreal knowlege.
