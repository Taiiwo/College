## Data Invalidation

--------------------
The data may be invalid as the system put in place to record the data does not perfoem sufficient data validation.

## Required Data Validation

Data vaidation that would need to be performed by the input program would be a system to input data by account, so only one technition can input data from them. This would stop incorrect spelling of names. Another imporvement would be to add a drop down menu for problem description instead of having the user type it in each time. This way, you won't have misspelled desctiptions.
 
## The Data in the Database may be Invalid

This is because the data input system is flawed, and allows invalid data.

##What I did to invalid data

To find invalid data, I made the graphs I required, but spotted anomylous results. When I found anomylous data, I corrected the data to what I thought it is supposed to be. This isn't ideal, but it is the best that can be done to invalid data.
