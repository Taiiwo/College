Unit 3 - Task 1
===============

Intro
-----
An information system is an integrated set of components for 
collecting, storing, and processing data and for 
delivering information, knowledge, and digital products. Business 
firms and other organizations rely on information
systems to carry out and manage their operations, interact with their 
customers and suppliers, and compete in the
marketplace.

Executive Support Systems
----------------------
####For this section, we will be using an executive support system for a supermarket's management staff.

##Features
### Description
The system allows you to make decisions based on your staff's 
behavior. It creates graphs and charts, as well 
as calculates real time information.

### Data Type
The executive support system uses, gathers and analyses and summaries 
the key internal and external information used in the business.

### Who is it Used by
Executive support systems are designed to help senior management make 
strategic decisions.

###Hardware Required
- Server - This is to receive all of the data, draw the graphs, and store the data in a locatable area
- Data Collection Units
    - For example:
    - Barcode scanners
    - Handheld stock checkers
    - Punchcard machine

###Software Required
- Server software to gather data and make graphs
- Client software to gather the information

###Telecommunications Required
- Local network
- Internet (Optional) - This is in case you want to factor in external information in order to process the data

##Functions
###Input
Data is input into the system via the client devices that connect to 
the server and input various information such as how much stock is 
left, for example.

###Collection
Data is collected via the client devices by using the interface on 
those. This interface is usually graphical, and has various buttons and 
text boxes in order to help data collection. The data is then collected 
by the server over the local network or via the internet every specified
period of time.

###Output
The system will usually output the information in a series of graphs 
and charts, as well as real time information that allow you to make 
informed decisions.

###storage
The data is stored on the server, usually on a SQL server in database 
format.

###Processing
The data is processed by the server in order to make the graphs and 
charts. Sometimes the data is specially formatted, such as 
capitalizing names and such.

###Retrieval
Many systems will allow you to export the data as an array of formats 
from PDF to CSV to JPG.

###Control and Feedback Loops
