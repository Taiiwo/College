Unit 3 - Task 1
===============

Intro
-----
An information system is an integrated set of components for collecting, 
storing, and processing data and for delivering information, knowledge, 
and digital products. Business firms and other organizations rely on 
information systems to carry out and manage their operations, interact with  
their customers and suppliers, and compete in the marketplace.

###The Difference Between an Open and a Closed System


Executive Support Systems
----------------------
##Features
### Description
The system allows you to make decicions based on your staff's 
behavior. It creates graphs and charts, as well 
as real time information.

### Data Type
The executive support system uses, gathers and analyses and summarises the 
key internal and external information used in the business.

### Who is it Used by
Executive support systems are designed to help senior management make
strategic decisions.

###Hardware Required
- Server
- Data Collection Units

###Software Required
- Server software to gather data and make graphs
- Client software to gather the information

###Telecomunications Required
- Local network

##Functions
###Input
Data is input into the system via the client devices that connect to 
the server and input various information such as how much stock is 
left, for example.

###Collection
Data is collected via the client devices by using the interface on 
those. This interface is usually graphical, and has various buttons and 
text boxes in order to help data collection. The data is then collected 
by the server over the local network every specified period of time.

###Output
The system will usually output the information in a series of graphs 
and charts, as well as real time information that allow you to make 
informed decicions.

###storage
The data is stored on the server, usually on a SQL server in database 
format.

###Processing
The data is processed by the server in order to make the graphs and 
charts. Sometimes the data is specially formatted, such as 
capitalizing names and such.

###Retreival
Many systems will allow you to export the data as an array of formats 
from PDF to CSV to JPG.

###Control and Feedback Loops
Control and feedback loops are put in place so that the users can input 
their feedback, and the system can be updated to address their complaints. 
For example, if someone doesn't like the way that the data is input, they 
can reccomend it for change.
