College Work
=======

Categorzation and File Formats
------------------------------

This repository will be the location for all possible coursework or mine. The documents in /documents will be in MarkDown so
as to be directly readable from GitHub (And also because MarkDown is awesome). Any other documents will be in LibreOffice format.
I assume your 'all powerful' 'Microsoft Office' can handle that. As it appears, a lot of my work will be
webpages due to a lot of my work being examples of web interfaces. Those websites can be found in the /websites folder.
