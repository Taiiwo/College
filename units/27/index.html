Web Server Scripting Languages
------------------------------

There are many different languages that can be used for server-side scripting
as there are many different web server softwares allow for different languages
and interperiters to control output of files. This basically means that any
language that can output text can also be used for web server scripting.
However, due to the syntax and inbuilt functions of certain languages, there
are languages, with the inclusion of languages that were built specifically for
server side scripting, there exists a few languages that are commonly used over
the rest:

- PHP - PHP: Hypertext Pre-processor
- ASP.NET - Active Server Pages
- Python
- Perl

PHP - PHP: Hyper Pre-processor
------------------------------

PHP is an open-source programming language that is written specifically for web
servers. In syntax, it is very similar to ASP.NET, but with the added
functionality and flexibility of it being compatible with almost all web
servers, and the inherent advantages of it being open-source.

ASP.NET - Active Server Pages
-----------------------------

ASP.NET was a scripting language created by the Microsoft Corporation. It was
originally added to Microsoft's IIS server as an addon, but is now a standard
component in the build.

Python
------

Python is an interperated language that was created as a high level scripting
language, not a web server scripting language. Using premade webservers written
in Python, or using existing web server software such as Apache or nGinX, it is
possible for you to use mods to execute the Python scripts.

Perl
------

Using premade webservers written in Perl, or using existing web server software
such as Apache or nGinX, it is possible for you to use mods to execute the Perl
scripts. Perl is an interperated language that was created as a high level
scripting language, not a web server scripting language.

Static vs. Dynamic
------------------------------

### *Static*
Static webpages are any type of webpage that doesn't move. The best way to
identify a static webpage is to imagine printing it, and ask yourself if you'd
lose any of the page's functionality. Static webpages are good for things like
information-only sites. They have low resource usage as they run no code on
either the server-side, or the client-side. Static webpages are written entirely
in HTML and CSS.

### *Dynamic*
Dynamic webpages are webpages that have content that changes dynamically. The information on the webpage can be different on each page load, or even while the page is being displayed. This allows web developers to add content to websites that makes websites more interactive, such as having slide-in navivation bars, or, I don't know, something like a webpage you can navigate entirely with the arrow keys ;)

Client-Side vs. Server-Side
---------------------------------------

### *Server-Side*
Server-side scripting allows programs to modify the contents of the HTML that is sent to the client-side. This can be useful as the code is never seen by the client, and therefore they cannot see how the data on the page has been put there. You will see this a lot with companies that don't want you to be able to see their methods. Another advantage of server-side scripting is that secure functions may be run. Things like accessing databases and running high priority software on the server can be done from server-side languages. This is useful when you don't want the client to have access to certain functions for security reasons.

### *Client-Side*
Client-side code is code that runs inside the browser. It does not need the page to reload to execute, and therefore it can make the page dynamic and responsive. There have been developed many pre-written libraries for doing all sorts of amazing things. For example, behind this text, you can see the output of Trianglify.js. This dynamically creates large SVG images for use as page backgrounds, and signifigantly speeds up page loads over useing large images as backgrounds.

Examples of Server-side Scripting 1
-------------------------------------------------

One example of a use of server-side scripting is in a login system. Login systems are used to identify users. They are fairly simple, but it's very important that it's secure. A server-side login system could allow users to register a username and password, and store it in the database. The system can then assign information to that person's identity, and use the fact that they know the username-password combination to verify that they are the person they say they are.

Examples of Server-side Scripting 2
-------------------------------------------------

Another example of a server-side scripting application is that of a shopping cart system. This allows a user have a list of items saved across pages that they can use to buy more than one thing at once. This can be done by storing the items in a database table, with one field as the userID, and the other as the itemID.
				</xmd>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<div class="intro">
				<xmd>
Examples of Server-side Scripting 3
-------------------------------------------------

Another use of server-side scripting is using the ability to upload files to the server. Using a HTML form with a file selector, you can send files in POST to a server side script. The server will take the POST data from the HTTP request and save the file to a location on the server storage. This can then be accessable from the same webserver, for download or viewing.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Server-Side Scripting
---------------------------------------------------------------

### *Advantages:*

- Can run high security code without being shown to the public
- Can run functions that are unavailable to the client-side

### *Disadvantages:*

- Significant server load for complex functions over a large userbase
- Inherent security risks of an interpreted language with full machine access

How PHP can Improve Accessibility
-------------------------------------------------

Things like changing font sizes and faces are best suited to client-side scripting, but the ability to have these settings remain from browser to browser, the use of server-side scripting is required.

While the user will still be required to log in to access these settings, their prefered font settings and other such accessibility setting could be saved to their user information in the database, and when the client-side is pulling down profile information such as your name, it could also be pulling down your display settings, and changing the webpage to match.
