Web Server Scripting Language
-----------------------------

There are many different languages that can be used for server-side scripting 
as there are many different web server softwares allow for different languages 
and interperiters to control output of files. This basically means that any 
language that can output text can also be used for web server scripting. 
However, due to the syntax and inbuilt functions of certain languages, there 
are languages, with the inclusion of languages that were built specifically for 
server side scripting, there exists a few languages that are commonly used over 
the rest:

- PHP
- ASP.NET
- Python
- Perl

PHP - PHP: Hyper Pre-processor
------------------------------

PHP is an open-source programming language that is written specifically for web 
servers. In syntax, it is very similar to ASP.NET, but with the added 
functionality and flexibility of it being compatible with almost all web 
servers, and the inherent advantages of it being open-source.

ASP.NET - Active Server Pages
-----------------------------

ASP.NET was a scripting language created by the Microsoft Corporation. It was 
originally added to Microsoft's IIS server as an addon, but is now a standard 
component in the build.

Python
------

Python is an interperated language that was created as a high level scripting 
language, not a web server scripting language. Using premade webservers written 
in Python, or using existing web server software such as Apache or nGinX, it is 
possible for you to use mods to execute the Python scripts.

Perl
------

Using premade webservers written in Perl, or using existing web server software 
such as Apache or nGinX, it is possible for you to use mods to execute the Perl 
scripts. Perl is an interperated language that was created as a high level 
scripting language, not a web server scripting language.
