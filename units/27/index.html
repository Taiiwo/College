Web Server Scripting Language
-----------------------------

There are many different languages that can be used for server-side scripting
as there are many different web server softwares allow for different languages
and interperiters to control output of files. This basically means that any
language that can output text can also be used for web server scripting.
However, due to the syntax and inbuilt functions of certain languages, there
are languages, with the inclusion of languages that were built specifically for
server side scripting, there exists a few languages that are commonly used over
the rest:

- PHP
- ASP.NET
- Python
- Perl

PHP - PHP: Hyper Pre-processor
------------------------------

PHP is an open-source programming language that is written specifically for web
servers. In syntax, it is very similar to ASP.NET, but with the added
functionality and flexibility of it being compatible with almost all web
servers, and the inherent advantages of it being open-source.

Processing: Static vs. Dynamic
------------------------------

### *Static*
Static webpages are any type of webpage that doesn't move. The best way to
identify a static webpage is to imagine printing it, and ask yourself if you'd
lose any of the page's functionality. Static webpages are good for things like
information-only sites. They have low resource usage as they run no code on
either the server-side, or the client-side. Static webpages are written entirely
in HTML and CSS.

### *Dynamic*
Dynamic webpages are webpages that have content that changes dynamically. The information on the webpage can be different on each page load, or even while the page is being displayed. This allows web developers to add content to websites that makes websites more interactive, such as having slide-in navivation bars, or, I don't know, something like a webpage you can navigate entirely with the arrow keys ;)

Processing: Client-Side vs. Server-Side
------------------------------

### *Server-Side*
Server-side scripting allows programs to modify the contents of the HTML that is sent to the client side.

### *Client-Side*

/*
Processing – static vs dynamic and difference between server side and client
side scripting e.g. Javascript

Functionality – describe three things that server side scripting can be used
for e.g. shopping karts, reserve order, manage user profile, web content
management, upload files, website analysis

Features - describe two advantages e.g. interpreted scripts as alternative to
compiled code, run as lower overhead code inside web server plugins, hide web
 server interface inside economical APIs; and two disadvantages e.g. increased
 complexity, reduced performance, code is interpreted not compiled; of web
 server scripting

Accessibility – features that improve client user experience e.g. alternative text, resizable fonts, support for screen readers, adjustable fonts; that can be incorporated through web server scripting
