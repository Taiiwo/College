Web Server Scripting Languages
------------------------------

There are many different languages that can be used for server-side scripting
as there are many different web server softwares allow for different languages
and interpreters to control output of files. This basically means that any
language that can output text can also be used for web server scripting.
However, due to the syntax and inbuilt functions of certain languages, there
are languages, with the inclusion of languages that were built specifically for
server side scripting, there exists a few languages that are commonly used over
the rest:

- PHP - PHP: Hypertext Pre-processor
- ASP.NET - Active Server Pages
- Python
- Perl
				</xmd>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<div class="intro">
				<xmd>
PHP - PHP: Hyper Pre-processor
------------------------------

PHP is an open-source programming language that is written specifically for web
servers. In syntax, it is very similar to ASP.NET, but with the added
functionality and flexibility of it being compatible with almost all web
servers, and the inherent advantages of it being open-source.

		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<div class="intro">
				<xmd>
ASP.NET - Active Server Pages
-----------------------------

ASP.NET was a scripting language created by the Microsoft Corporation. It was
originally added to Microsoft's IIS server as an addon, but is now a standard
component in the build.

			<div class="intro">
				<xmd>
Python
------

Python is an interpreted language that was created as a high level scripting
language, not a web server scripting language. Using pre-made webservers written
in Python, or using existing web server software such as Apache or nGinX, it is
possible for you to use mods to execute the Python scripts.

Perl
------

Using pre-made webservers written in Perl, or using existing web server software
such as Apache or nGinX, it is possible for you to use mods to execute the Perl
scripts. Perl is an interpreted language that was created as a high level
scripting language, not a web server scripting language.

Static vs. Dynamic
------------------------------

### *Static*
Static webpages are any type of webpage that doesn't move. The best way to
identify a static webpage is to imagine printing it, and ask yourself if you'd
lose any of the page's functionality. Static webpages are good for things like
information-only sites. They have low resource usage as they run no code on
either the server-side, or the client-side. Static webpages are written entirely
in HTML and CSS.

### *Dynamic*
Dynamic webpages are webpages that have content that changes dynamically. The information on the webpage can be different on each page load, or even while the page is being displayed. This allows web developers to add content to websites that makes websites more interactive, such as having slide-in navigation bars, or, I don't know, something like a webpage you can navigate entirely with the arrow keys ;)

Client-Side vs. Server-Side
---------------------------------------

### *Server-Side*
Server-side scripting allows programs to modify the contents of the HTML that is sent to the client-side. This can be useful as the code is never seen by the client, and therefore they cannot see how the data on the page has been put there. You will see this a lot with companies that don't want you to be able to see their methods. Another advantage of server-side scripting is that secure functions may be run. Things like accessing databases and running high priority software on the server can be done from server-side languages. This is useful when you don't want the client to have access to certain functions for security reasons.

### *Client-Side*
Client-side code is code that runs inside the browser. It does not need the page to reload to execute, and therefore it can make the page dynamic and responsive. There have been developed many pre-written libraries for doing all sorts of amazing things. For example, behind this text, you can see the output of Trianglify.js. This dynamically creates large SVG images for use as page backgrounds, and significantly speeds up page loads over using large images as backgrounds.

Examples of Server-side Scripting 1
-------------------------------------------------

One example of a use of server-side scripting is in a login system. Login systems are used to identify users. They are fairly simple, but it's very important that it's secure. A server-side login system could allow users to register a username and password, and store it in the database. The system can then assign information to that person's identity, and use the fact that they know the username-password combination to verify that they are the person they say they are.

Examples of Server-side Scripting 2
-------------------------------------------------

Another example of a server-side scripting application is that of a shopping cart system. This allows a user have a list of items saved across pages that they can use to buy more than one thing at once. This can be done by storing the items in a database table, with one field as the userID, and the other as the itemID.
				</xmd>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="slide">
			<div class="intro">
				<xmd>
Examples of Server-side Scripting 3
-------------------------------------------------

Another use of server-side scripting is using the ability to upload files to the server. Using a HTML form with a file selector, you can send files in POST to a server side script. The server will take the POST data from the HTTP request and save the file to a location on the server storage. This can then be accessible from the same webserver, for download or viewing.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Server-Side Scripting
---------------------------------------------------------------

### *Advantages:*

- Can run high security code without being shown to the public
- Can run functions that are unavailable to the client-side

### *Disadvantages:*

- Significant server load for complex functions over a large userbase
- Inherent security risks of an interpreted language with full machine access

			<div class="intro">
				<xmd>
Advantages of Server-Side Scripting
-----------------------------------

### Security
So, in server-side scripting, all of the code is stored an executed on the server side.
This means that the client cannot see the code.

### More Powerful
Server-side scrips are executed as native applications, and forward their results to the user.
As opposed to client-side scripting, where scripts are executed within the browser and are very closely
watched so as to reduce malicious execution.

			<div class="intro">
				<xmd>
Disadvantages of Server-Side Scripting
--------------------------------------

### Server Load
If a company has a large user base, then the power of the server needs to be signifigantly higher
than that of a client-side application.

### Security
Running code on the server-side has signifigant risks as any code

How PHP can Improve Accessibility
-------------------------------------------------

Things like changing font sizes and faces are best suited to client-side scripting, but the ability to have these settings remain from browser to browser requires the use of server-side scripting.

While the user will still be required to log in to access these settings, their preferred font settings and other such accessibility settings could be saved to their user information in the database, and when the client-side is pulling down profile information such as your name, it could also be pulling down your display settings, and changing the webpage to match.

| Functionality			| Client-Side | Server-Side | Example |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Shell access			| &#10007;		| &#10003;		| Server maintenance through a web interface |
| Visually dynamic	| &#10003;		| &#10007;		| Drop-down menus |
| Access to internet| &#10007;		| &#10003;		| Access to external APIs |
| Visible to public | &#10003;		| &#10007;		| The user is able to read the code before it is executed |

Example 1 - MDPro by Taiiwo
---------------------------
MDPro is a markdown editor for the browser that is completely free and allows exportation to almost every format imaginable. The website uses client-side scripting for all of the text rendering, drop down menus, styles, and text editing; but uses server-side scripting for converting the markdown into the desired format, as this process is too complicated for the front end to handle, and will probably only be executed once or twice.

Example 2 - HackPanel by NottingHackers
---------------------------------------
HackPanel is a modular dashboard for hackathons. It aims to be a little like Wolfram Alpha, but for more social and real time things, like who's doing what. You simply type in the event you want to see live information on in the top, and the app will search for relevant plugins for your search, and puts them in little movable boxes. The movable plugin boxes are entirely client-side code, but the plugin data itself is loaded in from the server-side.

Example 3 - TheScoop by TheSpoons
---------------------------------
The Scoop aggregates popular news links from a time frame. On expanding these links, a summary of the article is generated. The links are displayed in a minimalist, mobile friendly list that uses client-side scripting to expand on click, then uses and AJAX request to the local server to execute the OTS Unix binary, then returns the summarised article.

Security Issues
---------------
Using server-side scripting opens some large holes in security, and pushes into some controversial ground in terms of ethics.
				</xmd>
			</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<div class="intro">
				<xmd>
Server-Side Security Issues
---------------------------

Server-side code has comparatively and infinitely higher level of authority over the server machine when compaired to client-side. For this reason, when we look a the drawbacks of server-side scripting, it hold a considerable threat in respect to the heightened possibility of security vulnerabilities due to improperly sanitised user-input.

Server-side code almost always takes in data from the user, and if this data is not handled properly, it may be possible to format the data in a way that is able to take over the server-side interpretor, giving an attacker some access to the server machine.

			<div class="intro">
				<xmd>
Issues in Server-Side Ethics
----------------------------

When dealing with server-side scripting, it cannot be ignored that a user's data must be passed through a centralised source before it is used. This lowers the privacy of the users' information, as the data could be logged or sold on. There is the further dispute that the user is unable to see the code that is executed server-side. Unlike client-side code, which can be read and debugged using the developer tools in your browser; server-side code cannot be viewed in any such way, and thus restricts the user's confidence in the webserver.

Addressing Server-Side Security
-------------------------------
As outlined in previous pages, server-side scripting has considerable drawbacks in terms of security. To the extent that most web developers try to use as little of it as possible. For some things, it's needed, so how do we protect our servers from attack?

The trick to making your code safe for public interaction is to be absolutely brutal when it comes to data validation.
- Make sure that if anything is out of place, your code stops, and does nothing else.
- Double and triple check your regexes with a regex debugger
	- Get someone to read your regex and ask them if they can see any exceptions
- If something is going into a URL, make sure you encode it.

## IF SOMETHING IS BEING USED IN AN SQL QUERY, SQL. ESCAPE. SPECIAL. CHARS.
This is so dangerous, and will simply allow anyone full access you your database if not handled correctly.
