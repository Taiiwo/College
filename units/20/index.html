                    <p>
                        We sell a range of designer watches for men and women.
                        We have a small number of loyal customers

                    <p>
                        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of
                        denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I
                        will give you a complete account of the system, and
                        expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of
                        the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
                        rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because
                        it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how
                        to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences
                        that are extremely painful.
                    </p>
                    <i class="material-icons">fast_forward</i>
                    <p>
                        Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or
                        desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain,
                        but because occasionally circumstances occur in which
                        toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To
                        take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes
                        laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
                        advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault
                        with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no
                        annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
                        produces no resultant pleasure?
                    </p>
                    <i class="material-icons">attach_money</i>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous
                        indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                        demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
                        blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
                        trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs
                        to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will,
                        which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil
                        and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
                        distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice
                        is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being
                        able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
                        welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
                        circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
                        obligations of business it will frequently occur that.
